pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        # This step is named to reflect its purpose: installing dependencies and running tests.
        # It is the first step in the CI/CD process, preparing the project for build and deployment.
        name: "Install and Test"
        # Caches the node_modules directory to speed up installations in subsequent runs.
        # This cache is reused across builds to reduce build times and bandwidth usage.
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - echo "Installing dependencies..."
          # Forcefully installs all dependencies ensuring that any potential cache-related issues are avoided.
          # The `--force` flag can help resolve certain conflicts and ensure all packages are installed from scratch.
          - npm install --force
          - echo "Running tests..."
          # Executes the 'test' script defined in package.json, which should run any unit tests.
          # Typically, this might use a framework like Jest, and this step ensures all tests pass before moving forward.
          - npm test

    - step:
        name: "Build and Minify"
        caches:
        - node  # Utilize caching for node modules to speed up the build process
        script:
        - echo "Forcefully reinstalling all dependencies to ensure a clean and consistent state..."
        # The --force flag ensures that all dependencies are reinstalled even if they are already present,
        # helping to resolve any issues with corrupted or improperly linked packages.
        - npm install --force

        - echo "Listing all installed modules to confirm installations..."
        # This command lists the entire dependency tree, which is useful for verifying that all expected packages
        # are installed correctly before proceeding to the build step.
        - npm list

        - echo "Displaying contents of the node_modules directory..."
        # Listing the contents of the node_modules directory to visually confirm that all expected packages,
        # including those that might not be explicitly listed in package.json, are present.
        - ls -la node_modules/

        - echo "Explicitly installing and verifying mini-css-extract-plugin..."
        # Reinstalling mini-css-extract-plugin to ensure it's present. This step is crucial because missing this plugin
        # would cause the Webpack build to fail when it tries to process CSS files.
        - npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin

        - echo "Verifying mini-css-extract-plugin installation..."
        # Lists mini-css-extract-plugin to confirm it's correctly installed in the node_modules directory,
        # providing a specific check for this critical build dependency.
        - npm list mini-css-extract-plugin

        - echo "Running build with Webpack..."
        # Executes the 'build' script from package.json. This script is expected to invoke Webpack,
        # which will bundle and minify the application's JavaScript and CSS files according to the configurations
        # specified in webpack.config.js.
        - npm run build

        - echo "Build and minification complete."
        # Indicates the end of the build process. If no errors occur, this message confirms that the application
        # was successfully compiled and minified.


    - step:
        # This step simulates the deployment of the project to a staging environment.
        name: "Deploy to Staging"
        script:
          - echo "Deploying to staging environment..."
          # Creates a temporary directory that simulates a staging environment.
          - mkdir -p /tmp/staging/
          # Copies the build artifacts to the staging directory to simulate deployment.
          - cp -R build/* /tmp/staging/
          - echo "Deployment complete. Files are in /tmp/staging/"
