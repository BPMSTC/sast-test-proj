### ⚙️ Configuration Files

#### `package.json`
- **Purpose**: Node.js project configuration
- **Scripts**:
  - `test`: Runs Jest tests
  - `build`: Executes Webpack build process
  - `minify`: Additional minification step
- **Dependencies**:
  - **Production**: jQuery
  - **Development**: Jest, Webpack, Babel, UglifyJS

#### `webpack.config.js`
- **Purpose**: Webpack build configuration

  - Babel transpilation (ES6+ → ES5)
  - CSS extraction and minification
  - JavaScript minification with Terser

#### `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`
- **Purpose**: SAST-enhanced CI/CD pipeline configuration with manual triggers
- **Pipeline Types**:
  - **Automatic Pipeline** (triggered on push):
    1. **Install and Test**: Dependencies + unit tests
    2. **Build and Minify**: Webpack build process
    3. **Deploy to Staging**: Simulated staging deployment
    4. **Mock Release to Production**: Simulated production deployment
  - **Manual Pipelines** (custom triggers):
    - **security-scan**: SAST security analysis only
    - **full-sast-pipeline**: Complete SAST analysis + build + deploy

## CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

### 🔄 Pipeline Stages

1. **📦 Install and Test**
   ```yaml
   - Install dependencies with npm
   - Run unit tests with Jest
   - Cache node_modules for speed
   ```

2. **🔨 Build and Minify**
   ```yaml
   - Verify all dependencies
   - Run Webpack build process
   - Generate minified bundles
   ```

3. **🚀 Deploy to Staging**
   ```yaml
   - Copy build artifacts to staging
   - Simulate staging environment
   - Validate deployment
   ```

4. **🎯 Mock Release to Production**
   ```yaml
   - Copy build artifacts to production
   - Simulate production deployment
   - Complete the pipeline
   ```

### 🛠️ Build Process

1. **Dependency Installation**
   - npm installs all required packages
   - Caching improves build speed

2. **Testing Phase**
   - Jest runs all unit tests
   - Tests must pass for pipeline to continue

3. **Build Phase**
   - Webpack bundles JavaScript and CSS
   - Babel transpiles modern JavaScript
   - Files are minified for production

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Build artifacts are copied to target environments
   - Simulates real-world deployment process

## Key Learning Concepts

### 🎯 CI/CD Benefits
- **Automated Testing**: Catch bugs early
- **Consistent Builds**: Same process every time
- **Faster Deployments**: Reduce manual errors
- **Quality Assurance**: Tests run automatically

### 🔧 Modern Development Tools
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **Webpack**: Module bundler and build tool
- **Babel**: JavaScript transpiler
- **npm**: Package manager

### 📚 Best Practices Demonstrated
- **Modular Code**: Separate concerns into different files
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Build Optimization**: Minification and bundling
- **Pipeline Automation**: Automated quality checks

## How to Use This Project

### 🚀 Running Locally

npm run build

# Open index.html in a browser
```

### 🔄 Triggering the Pipeline
1. Push code to Bitbucket repository
2. Pipeline automatically starts
3. Monitor progress in Bitbucket interface
4. Review build logs and test results

## Educational Value

This project teaches students:
- How CI/CD pipelines work in practice
- Modern JavaScript development practices
- Automated testing strategies
- Build and deployment processes
- Real-world development workflows

## Next Steps for Learning

1. **Modify the code** and see how the pipeline responds
2. **Add new tests** to understand testing best practices
3. **Customize the build process** by modifying webpack.config.js
4. **Experiment with the pipeline** by adding new stages
5. **Study the generated build artifacts** in the build/ directory
